                    <p>Through a series of contextual interviews with employees from all levels
                        and creating an affinity wall we were able to idenfity the source of
                        the ORSP's communication issues.

                    <p>After identifying these pain points we developed solutions to reduce
                        information overload in ORSP employee email inboxes and improve client inquiry
                        response times. Our recommendations included:

                    <p>Through research and interviews my team identified three primary needs
                        of Detroit students:</p>
                    <ul class="portfolio-ul">
                        <li>Engaging and interactive learning experiences</li>
                        <li>Connectivity to the cultural center</li>
                        <li>An avenue to contribute their own ideas and creativity within
                            the cultural center
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="portfolio-h2">Vision and solution</h2>
                    <p>Our research on the cultural district, technological
                        access, and physical transportation in Detroit and
                        interviews with two high school teachers led to our focus
                        on a digital experience that builds on an understanding of how
                        students use technology to form social connections and have fun
                        utilizing interactive technologies to engage with their community.
                        We drew inspiration from other digital games that allow users to
                        collaborate and be creative such as MineCraft and Fortnite.

                    <p>Decrypt Detroit is a digitally-based competition spanning the cultural district.
                        The application provides "missions" for students to complete
                        throughout the district, challenging users to visit all of the institutions
                        to complete scavenger hunts and create challenges unique to each location.
                        Scavenger hunts unique to each institution will lead players through each location,
                        and points can be earned by finding and scanning QR codes throughout the institutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin the game, players join a team with their friends or other online users and
                        compete against different teams to complete the most missions and claim ‘zones’
                        marked by digital displays placed in front of each institution throughout the district.
                        Along the way, players are invited to express their unique perspective on Detroit by
                        sharing photos that respond to historical and cultural prompts. These prompts invite
                        users to share their own perspective on the city of Detroit and allow their voices to
                        be heard and seen throughout the district. Responses to cultural prompts will be made
                        visible on the digital displays placed outside of each institution. The game culminates
                        in a winning team based on the points earned throughout scavenger hunts and creative
                        challenges in each institution or ‘zone’.

                    <p>Garden Works is a small organic farm located in Ann Arbor, MI.
                        The goal of this project is to develop a website for the farm with
                        product availability and online order components using Square. The website will be
                        developed using Django.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="portfolio-h3">Application Development</h2>
                    <p>The foundation for the site will began with building databases to store
                        product information, customer information, and order information.

                    <p>Following the creation of those databases, I will develop an order
                        summary of the items contained in a shopping cart.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the third step I will create a checkout form, allowing users to submit
                        an order and allowing the order accessed and saved in the database.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly, I will implement payment processing using Square.</p>
