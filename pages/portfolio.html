                <p>Through a series of contextual interviews with employees from all levels
                    and creating an affinity wall we were able to idenfity the source of
                    the ORSP's communication issues.

                <p>After identifying these pain points we developed solutions to reduce

                <p>Through research and interviews my team identified three primary needs
                    of Detroit students:</p>
                <ul class="portfolio-ul">
                    <li>Engaging and interactive learning experiences</li>
                    <li>Connectivity to the cultural center</li>
                    <li>An avenue to contribute their own ideas and creativity within
                        the cultural center
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="portfolio-h3">Vision and solution</h3>
                <p>Our research on the cultural district, technological
                    access, and physical transportation in Detroit and
                    interviews with two high school teachers led to our focus
                    on a digital experience that builds on an understanding of how
                    students use technology to form social connections and have fun
                    utilizing interactive technologies to engage with their community.
                    We drew inspiration from other digital games that allow users to
                    collaborate and be creative such as MineCraft and Fortnite.

                <img src="../images/login.jpg" alt="app design" class="portfolio-image">
                <p>Decrypt Detroit is a digitally-based competition spanning the cultural district.
                    The application provides "missions" for students to complete
                    throughout the district, challenging users to visit all of the institutions
                    to complete scavenger hunts and create challenges unique to each location.
                    Scavenger hunts unique to each institution will lead players through each location,
                    and points can be earned by finding and scanning QR codes throughout the institutions.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/QR_code.jpg" alt="QR code" class="portfolio-image">
                <p>
                    To begin the game, players join a team with their friends or other online users and
                    compete against different teams to complete the most missions and claim ‘zones’
                    marked by digital displays placed in front of each institution throughout the district.
                    Along the way, players are invited to express their unique perspective on Detroit by
                    sharing photos that respond to historical and cultural prompts. These prompts invite
                    users to share their own perspective on the city of Detroit and allow their voices to
                    be heard and seen throughout the district. Responses to cultural prompts will be made
                    visible on the digital displays placed outside of each institution. The game culminates
                    in a winning team based on the points earned throughout scavenger hunts and creative
                    challenges in each institution or ‘zone’.

                <p>Garden Works is a small organic farm located in Ann Arbor, MI.
                    The goal of this project is to develop a website for the farm with
                    product availability and online order components using Square. The website will be
                    developed using Django.

                <h3 class="portfolio-h3">Application Development</h3>
                <p>The foundation for the site will began with building databases to store
                    product information, customer information, and order information.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/databases.png" alt="database diagram" class="portfolio-image">
                <p>Following the creation of those databases, I will develop an order
                    summary of the items contained in a shopping cart.
                </p>
                <p>In the third step I will create a checkout form, allowing users to submit
                    an order and allowing the order accessed and saved in the database.
                </p>
                <p>Lastly, I will implement payment processing using Square.</p>
